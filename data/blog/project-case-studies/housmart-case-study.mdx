## Summary of design
So I had to design something like a hub; for the user to change between these features, I decided
to make this hub the homepage. You can see I have placed some 3d vectors for the image of the
house on the hub page, but a user can change that image and replace it with a picture of his
house.

<div className="flex rounded-md flex-wrap -mx-2 overflow-hidden xl:-mx-2">
  <div className="my-1 rounded-md px-2 w-full overflow-hidden xl:my-1 xl:px-2 xl:w-1/2">
    <Image alt="Housmart" src="/static/images/housmart-hub.jpg" width={800} height={600} />
  </div>
</div>

Every part of the Housmart system has its own features, for the difference to be seen and felt, I
sacrificed the old way and played with colors, as you can see, there are like 10 or 11 colors in the
whole design. but they are all pastel colors for harmony. I used that colors for icons in the hub
and buttons inside the pages.
