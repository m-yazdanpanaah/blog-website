# Shoor, A Case Study

Shoor is a social media application that is based on the Instagram and Spotify. One app for listening to music, make playlists, follow artists and watch their live performances.

## About the name
For the name of this product, I wanted to pick a name that leaves a music kind effect on people.
finally, I came up with <span className="text-hearth">Shoor</span>.
shoor is a persian word that has two meanings:
1. Exciting and passionate
2. One of classic music instrument in iran

## User research
For this part, I've decided to use Competetive Analysis, that means:
<span className="font-bold"> "A competitive analysis is a strategy where you identify major competitors and research their products, sales, and marketing strategies. By doing this, you can create solid business strategies that improve upon your competitor's." </span>

[Hubspot](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/competitive-analysis-kit)

I had two big competitors:  <span className="text-hearth">Instagram</span> and  <span className="text-hearth">Spotify</span>.
So. I've decided to start starting on these two.

## Instagram
### 9 year old giant
Instagram is a great social media with 800 million users and this number is a little crazy for an app that just released for maybe 9 years. If you compare this numbers
with other applications through the history, you can notice this difference. So the reason of the popularity of Instagram is based
on the basic features of the ability to change throughout the years but despite the user friendliness and the great performance
on phones, it has some cons. Specially for music lovers and music artists.

### Paid live videos
In the times of Corona virus, many performers started to have their performances online. Instagram has this great feature that's called
live video but there is no way for performers to sell tickets and earn money from that. Shoor will do this.

### Announcement system for lives and news
So if you are a famous stand-up comedian that wants to have this big performance online on Instagram, you can't
let other people know, except by Stories and a really simple count-down system. I thought Shoor could have a
section in profiles, so the people know when the artist have their plans.

  <div className="my-1 rounded-md px-2 w-full overflow-hidden xl:my-1 xl:px-2 xl:w-1/2">
    <Image alt="shoor-profile page" src="/static/images/shoor-profile.png" width={800} height={600} />
  </div>
</div>

## Spotify
### An international green headphone
Spotify is a great platform for listening any kind of music. you can create a playlist with other people, follow
your favourite artists and just enjoy the music. But there are some cons in the social-part of the Spotify that
I should have fixed them on Shoor.

### Commenting on tracks
I don't know why, but you can just leave a comment on a song, and I think it would be very great if we can do that.
So in Shoor you can just leave comments under news, lives and songs.

<div className="flex rounded-md flex-wrap -mx-2 overflow-hidden xl:-mx-2">
  <div className="my-1 rounded-md px-2 w-full overflow-hidden xl:my-1 xl:px-2 xl:w-1/2">
